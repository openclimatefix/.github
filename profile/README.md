Open Climate Fix (OCF) is a non-profit company, focused on building AI tools for a greener grid.
Every path to net zero has the electricity grid at its heart.
At Open Climate Fix, we're delivering cutting-edge technology for industry to accelerate the energy transition.

## How to get involved?
At OCF we are passionate that all the knowledge we produce remains open, to break down intellectual property barriers and subsequently reduce the ‚Äútime to impact‚Äù. We therefore encourage external users to use our base code.

Here's how you can get involved:

### GitHub contributions

* Check out which [Github repositories](https://github.com/openclimatefix?view_as=public#overview-of-ocfs-repositories) are easy to contribute to in the section below using our (hopefully) helpful traffic light system üö¶;
* Have a look at our [list of "good first issues"](https://github.com/search?l=&p=1&q=user%3Aopenclimatefix+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22&ref=advsearch&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=open) ‚Äì these are GitHub Issues which do not require extensive familiarity with our code and should help get you started;
* We're also implementing a [contributions-welcome](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aopenclimatefix+label%3A%22contributions-welcome%22&ref=advsearch&type=issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=open) label to highlight issues we think are good for open source contribution. Note: this is a new tag, so not many issues use it yet! Feel free to ask to be assigned other issues, too, if something catches you eye, and we will be happy to clarify if it's community friendly.
* **Before you submit a pull request**, please ask to be assigned to the issue! Some issues are there for us to get back to and unfortunately might be completely inaccessible to OS contribution. Asking to be assigned first will prevent you from doing unnecessary work and lets everybody else know you're working on this already, so we don't get multiple PRs for the same issue;
* Once you're assigned to an issue, submit your PR and tag someone for a review! Our coding style is [here](https://github.com/openclimatefix/.github/blob/main/coding_style.md);
* First time contributing? Here's a [quick guide from firstcontributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) to help you get started!

### Other ways to get involved
* Sign up to our [newsletter](https://ocfnews.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=substack_profile) and follow us on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/openclimatefix.org) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/19123036/admin/) to learn the latest about our work;
* Use our datasets on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/openclimatefix) or [EUMETSAT satellite data](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/eumetsat-seviri-rss?hl=en-GB&project=solar-pv-nowcasting) and let us know if it was useful;
* Use our ML models on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/openclimatefix) and let us know if it was useful;
* Spread the word with your networks;
* Already contributed? Add OCF to the skills or volunteering section of your LinkedIn!
* Use our code(!) by following the guidelines below.

In order for us to understand the use of our models, and to demonstrate impact to future funders, it is invaluable for us to know who is using the code and, if possible, how.

We licence the code in this repository under a permissive MIT licence and if you are using the code or deriving from it, we request that you attribute the use of Open Climate Fix‚Äôs work in your product by adding the text below:

#### 'original code by [Open Climate Fix](https://github.com/openclimatefix)'

If you're a contributor, we'd love for you to share your work! We ask our community to refer to themselves as an Open Climate Fix Community Contributor, specifically across social media channels and on personal CVs or portfolios.

## How easy is it to get involved
We've set up this traffic light legend, so you can see how easy it is to get involved in each of our repositories.


| Level | Details|
|--- | ---- |
|[![ease of contribution: easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/ease%20of%20contribution:%20easy-32bd50)](https://github.com/openclimatefix/ocf-meta-repo?tab=readme-ov-file#how-easy-is-it-to-get-involved) | These projects are easy to run, standalone, and have easily readable code. There should be issues for everyone at different skill levels.                         |
| [![ease of contribution: medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/ease%20of%20contribution:%20medium-f4900c)](https://github.com/openclimatefix/ocf-meta-repo?tab=readme-ov-file#how-easy-is-it-to-get-involved)  | These projects are accessible to contributors but might depend on your skill level. They might depend on another bit of code or need you to investigate a little bit.
| [![ease of contribution: hard](https://img.shields.io/badge/ease%20of%20contribution:%20hard-bb2629)](https://github.com/openclimatefix/ocf-meta-repo?tab=readme-ov-file#how-easy-is-it-to-get-involved) | We would not recommend going into these projects. They haven't been made "nice" and it might take a lot of digging in the code to understand what's going on.      |

You will usually see one of the corresponding badges on the repo's README.
